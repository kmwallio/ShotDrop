# ShotDrop

I found out my camera supports FTP upload, so naturally I had to come up with an excuse to use it.

## Goals

* FTP Upload Support
    + Generate previews and "common" sizes then push files to S3 compatible storage
* Open files for editing in [PhotoPea](https://www.photopea.com/)
* Share images on [twitter](https://twitter.com) or other social media
* Galleries (Public/Private)
* Embed Codes
* Live Refresh as photos come in
